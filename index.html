        <h4>Interests & Hobbies</h4>
        <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
        <p>I typically spend as much time with my friends and family as possible. I want to cherish every moment I can with them because life is extremely unpredictable. When I am with my family I am typically watching Bollywood movies üé• with them or playing cards üÉè.</p>
        <p>Watching Netflix is how I spend most of my time alone. I enjoy a varaiety of generes including action üî´, romance ‚ù§Ô∏è, and horror üëπ. If I had to pick an all time favourite show I would pick Suits ‚ô†Ô∏è (how original). I also enjoy comedies such as Brooklyn-99 and Modern Family. For my favourite movie I would pick Pacific Rim. Not Pacific Rim: Uprising because that one was a joke ü§°.</p>
        <p>I love cooking üë®‚Äçüç≥ and because of that my diet is not always the most nutritious. I try to stay as consistent as possible with the gym but it's difficult to balance with school sometimes. I am currently on a chest-back-arms-legs split and I do not purposely skip leg day üí™.</p>
        <p>Volleyball üèê and basketball üèÄ are some of my favourite sports (maybe because I'm above avrage height üòÇ). I honestly can play any sport and am very open minded about what form of physical activity to do. Often times I let others decide because I am not too picky about it. I don't care if it is a new game or something I am not the best at, as long as everyone enjoys it üòÉ.</p>
        <p>I like to code in some of my free time. I have been in love with programming ever since I was first introduced to it over ten years ago. Ever since then it has been my dream to become a developer. I like knowing that people are using the programs I create and in some way I have made their lives easier (hopefully).</p>
